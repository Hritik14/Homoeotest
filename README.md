Do not conduct remote tests with this application. This is made for LAN tests where candidates can be supervised.  
The script sends *all* answers to the browser which enables it to re-conduct the test without any network requirement, the same feature enables anyone accessing the source code to know the correct answers.  
Anyways, the correct answers are always displayed at the end as results.
